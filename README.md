# Genomcore-sdk-python - Additional Material

## Overview

This repository provides supplementary materials for the Genomcore-sdk-python project. The goal is to give users a tangible and conceptual understanding of the Genomcore-sdk-python functions, its methods, and how it can be applied in various use cases. Additionally, it showcases interactions with the Python ecosystem to illustrate potential integrations and functionalities.

## Repository Structure

- **Test-datasets/**: Contains sample time-series datasets in CSV, XLSX and JSON format.
- **Example_1.py**: Demonstrates various use cases of the Genomcore-sdk-python client, including uploading hemodynamic time-series, creating patient records, deleting records and creating terminologies.
- **Example_2.py**: Showcases additional functionalities and interactions with the Python ecosystem, including data import/export, processing and statistical analysis within different Python packages.
- **.env**: Environment variables required for authentication.
- **README.md**: This document.

## Note

These example scripts are designed to provide a conceptual understanding of how the Genomcore-sdk-python client can be utilized in various use cases. They are not intended to be executed directly as the users may not have access to the required authentication tokens and permissions.

## Additional Information

**Visualization Note:** The current Genomcore-sdk-python client does not have built-in visualization tools. The figures of the paper shown in the examples labeled “example of view on the platform” indicate that such visualizations are available through the Genomcore platform itself, not through the Genomcore-sdk-python client. For actual visualizations, users should utilize the Genomcore platform.
